# gtfs2gps package conventions

**Standard:** a CRAN-ready, correct, fast package. `R CMD check --as-cran`
returns 0 errors, 0 warnings, and only explained notes. New code reads like the
code around it.

Part A describes how gtfs2gps is written today (checked against the source on
2026-10-04). Items tagged **[NEW]** are decisions for new or modified code
only; never apply them to untouched code as drive-bys. Part B is the general
CRAN standard. When they conflict, Part A wins; flag the conflict in the plan.

# Part A: gtfs2gps house style

## A1. Namespacing

- **Call dependencies as `package::function()`**: `data.table::`, `sf::`,
  `sfheaders::`, `units::`, `gtfstools::`, `future::`, `furrr::`,
  `progressr::`, `terra::`, `checkmate::`.
- **Existing `@importFrom`** (in `R/utils.R`): data.table `:=`, `%between%`,
  `fifelse`, `%chin%`; `stats::na.omit`; `utils` `head`, `tail`,
  `object.size`; `Rcpp::compileAttributes`; `lwgeom::st_geod_length`; plus
  `@useDynLib gtfs2gps, .registration = TRUE`. Don't add new `@importFrom`
  without a plan; **[NEW]** write `stats::`/`utils::` explicitly in new code
  (existing code has bare `na.omit()`, `object.size()`, `weighted.mean()`).
- Never use `library()`/`require()` in `R/`. Suggested packages are guarded
  with `requireNamespace("pkg", quietly = TRUE)`.
- Column names used with non-standard evaluation go into the
  `utils::globalVariables(c(...))` block in `R/zzz.R` (which also has a second,
  tiny one for `.` and `:=`). Append new names at the end; check for
  duplicates first.

## A2. Inputs, outputs and the two data shapes

gtfs2gps handles two kinds of objects:

| Object | What it is | Produced by |
|---|---|---|
| **GTFS** | a gtfstools `dt_gtfs` list of data.tables, read with only the fields gtfs2gps needs | `read_gtfs()` (wraps `gtfstools::read_gtfs(fields = ...)`) |
| **GPS** | one `data.table`; one row per point; columns `shape_id, trip_id, route_type, id, timestamp, shape_pt_lon, shape_pt_lat, stop_id, stop_sequence, speed, dist, cumdist, cumtime, trip_number` | `gtfs2gps()` |

- **GPS column types are part of the API.** `speed` is `units` km/h, `dist`
  and `cumdist` are `units` m, `cumtime` is `units` s, `timestamp` is
  `data.table::ITime`. Functions that take GPS data (`adjust_speed()`,
  `gps_as_sf*()`, `append_height()`) must accept and return these types. When
  computing, drop units, compute, and restore them before returning
  (`adjust_speed()` is the model). Numeric user arguments for speeds are
  interpreted as km/h and may also be `units` objects.
- **GTFS-side argument names:** `gtfs_data` in `gtfs2gps()` and
  `R/filter_gtfs.R`, `gtfs` elsewhere. Match the file; don't rename existing
  arguments (breaking change).
- `gtfs2gps()` accepts a path or an in-memory GTFS. Keep that.
- **Feeds may be frequency-based** (`frequencies.txt`; `saopaulo.zip` is).
  `test_gtfs_freq()` decides; `gtfs2gps()` converts with
  `gtfstools::frequencies_to_stop_times()`. New code must work for both kinds.
- **Validation:** existing exported functions validate little (ad-hoc
  `stop()`s in `gtfs2gps()` and `read_gtfs()`). **[NEW]** new or modified
  arguments are validated with `checkmate::assert_*` (already in Imports);
  enumerated options with `checkmate::assert_choice()` for a single value
  (e.g. `snap_method`), or `assert_names(subset.of =)` for several.
- Times: `stop_times_to_seconds()` (in place; the caller copies first; strings not
  matching `valid_gtfs_time` become `NA`) and `seconds_to_string()` in `R/utils.R`
  (`seconds_to_string()` needs an integer; wrap doubles in `as.integer()`).
  GTFS times may exceed 24:00:00; `adjust_speed()` wraps timestamps past
  86400 s. Keep that behaviour consistent when touching time code.

## A3. data.table, Rcpp and parallelism

- **Never modify the caller's objects.** Existing models:
  `gtfs2gps()` and `filter_valid_stop_times()` start with
  `data.table::copy()`; `adjust_speed()` exposes `clone = TRUE`;
  `gps_as_sflinestring()` copies before adding columns. Any `:=`/`set*()` on
  a table reachable from the input must be preceded by a copy or guarded by
  an explicit argument. (`gtfs_shapes_as_sf()` used to call `setDT()` on the
  input; since 2026-10-05 it delegates to gtfstools and copies.)
- Use `%chin%` for character membership, keyed / `on =` joins, and `by =`
  grouping. No new row-wise loops. `lapply` over shapes or trips followed by
  `data.table::rbindlist()` is the established pattern for per-group work.
- **Rcpp:** C++ lives in `src/*.cpp` with `// [[Rcpp::export]]`
  (`cpp_snap_points_nearest1/2`, `rcpp_distance_haversine`). After changing an
  export signature, regenerate `R/RcppExports.R` and `src/RcppExports.cpp`
  with `Rcpp::compileAttributes()` (`devtools::document()` also does it); never
  hand-edit them. `src/*.o` / `*.dll` are build artefacts (gitignored).
- **Parallelism:** `gtfs2gps(parallel = TRUE)` sets
  `future::plan("multisession", workers = ncores)` and restores the previous
  plan with `on.exit()`; work is spread over shapes with
  `furrr::future_map(..., .options = furrr::furrr_options(packages = ...))`
  and progress is reported with `progressr::progressor()`.
  - Worker code runs in **separate R processes**: `<<-`, `message()` side
    effects and closures over large objects behave differently than in
    sequential mode. Return information as values instead. (The existing
    `badShapes <<-` collector in `gtfs2gps()` is exactly this hazard;
    backlog.)
  - Any change to the worker path must give **identical results** with
    `parallel = FALSE` and `parallel = TRUE` (Gate 1).
  - Default `ncores` is `future::availableCores() - 1`, which respects CRAN's
    2-core limit. Never hard-code more than 2 workers in tests, examples or
    vignettes.

## A4. Messages, warnings and errors (cli)

**Decision (2026-10-04, maintainer):** gtfs2gps adopts `cli` for all
user-facing conditions. `cli` goes in `Imports`.

- **Use** `cli::cli_abort()`, `cli::cli_warn()` and `cli::cli_inform()`, never
  base `stop()`, `warning()`, `message()`, `print()` or `cat()` in new or
  modified code. Use inline markup: `{.arg spatial_resolution}`,
  `{.fn gtfs2gps}`, `{.file {path}}`, `{.val {shape_id}}`, `{.cls units}`, and
  pluralisation (`{n} shape{?s}`). Multi-part messages use a named vector
  (`c("Main sentence.", "i" = "hint", "x" = "problem")`).
- **Errors carry a class** when tests or users may want to catch them:
  `class = "gtfs2gps_<topic>_error"` (e.g. `gtfs2gps_empty_file_error`).
  Tests then use `expect_error(..., class = "...")` instead of matching text.
- `cli_abort()` reports the caller automatically; inside internal helpers pass
  `call = rlang::caller_env()` only if `rlang` is already a dependency,
  otherwise accept the default.
- **`quiet` still controls informative output.** `cli_inform()` emits a
  message condition, so `suppressMessages()` / the `quiet` argument keep
  working. Don't print progress with `cli` progress bars; progress stays with
  `progressr`.
- **Parallel workers:** conditions signalled inside `furrr::future_map()`
  workers are relayed by `future`, but don't rely on that for anything the
  main session must act on (A3); return information as values.
- **Existing base calls** (~38 in `R/gtfs2gps.R`, `R/read_gtfs.R`,
  `R/mod_updates.R`, `R/adjust_speed.R`, `R/filter_gtfs.R`) are migrated in a
  dedicated, planned change, not as drive-bys inside unrelated work. Until
  then, a function you are already modifying is migrated as a whole (all of its
  calls), so a function never mixes the two styles.
- Deprecations: `cli::cli_warn(class = "deprecated_<thing>", ...)` naming the
  replacement, tested with `expect_warning(..., class = "deprecated_<thing>")`,
  kept for at least one CRAN release (see `strategy` in `gtfs2gps()`).
  `lifecycle` is not a dependency.

## A5. Style

- 2-space indent, `<-`, snake_case for new functions and arguments, explicit
  `return()` at the end of functions.
- The code base mostly writes `if(`/`function(` without a space and puts
  data.table arguments on new lines with **leading commas**:
  ```r
  stops_seq[gtfs_data$stops
            , on = "stop_id"
            , c('stop_lat', 'stop_lon') := list(i.stop_lat, i.stop_lon)]
  ```
  Match the file you are editing; don't reformat untouched code.
- There is no `.lintr`; lintr output is advisory. Keep new lines ≲ 100
  columns.
- Remove dead commented-out code only in lines you are already changing.

## A6. Documentation (roxygen2, markdown off)

- Roxygen blocks use explicit `@title` and `@description`, then `@param`,
  `@return`, `@export`, `@examples`. Link with `\code{\link{fun}}` (Markdown
  mode is not enabled in DESCRIPTION; backticks render literally in older
  blocks).
- **Examples** use the bundled fixtures and stay small and fast: read
  `poa.zip`, subset to one shape and one trip.
  ```r
  #' poa <- read_gtfs(system.file("extdata/poa.zip", package = "gtfs2gps")) |>
  #'   gtfstools::filter_by_shape_id("T2-1") |>
  #'   filter_single_trip()
  ```
  Examples longer than ~5 s use `\donttest{}`, never `\dontrun{}`
  (`append_height()` currently uses `\dontrun{}`; backlog).
- Internal functions: `@noRd` (see `R/utils.R`). `test_gtfs_freq()` has
  roxygen without `@export`; match that only if a helper should be documented.
- Every new export is added to `pkgdown/_pkgdown.yml` if it gains a
  `reference:` index (today it has none; check with
  `pkgdown::check_pkgdown()`).
- Never hand-edit generated files:

  | Generated file | Regenerate with |
  |---|---|
  | `NAMESPACE`, `man/*.Rd` | `devtools::document()` |
  | `R/RcppExports.R`, `src/RcppExports.cpp` | `Rcpp::compileAttributes()` (`document()` also runs it) |

  `README.md` is hand-written (no `README.Rmd`).

## A7. Tests (testthat, edition 2)

- Files are `tests/testthat/test_<function>.R` (**underscore**). New files
  follow that. DESCRIPTION has no `Config/testthat/edition`, so the suite runs
  in edition 2 (`expect_equal(x, y, tolerance)` positional third argument is
  used). Switching to edition 3 needs a plan.
- Fixtures in `inst/extdata/`: `poa.zip` (stop_times-based, small),
  `saopaulo.zip` (frequency-based), `fortaleza.zip` + `fortaleza-srtm.tif`
  (heights), `berlin.zip`, `warsaw.zip`. Load with
  `system.file("extdata/<x>.zip", package = "gtfs2gps")`.
- Existing tests pin hard-coded expected values (row counts, mean speeds with
  a tolerance). When an algorithm change legitimately moves them, re-derive
  the new values, explain the change in the plan, and never just paste the new
  output.
- **New or modified functions** need at least:
  - an input-type / invalid-argument error test
  - the returned class and GPS column types (`units`, `ITime`) where relevant
  - **"doesn't change input data"**: `old <- data.table::copy(x)`; call;
    `expect_equal(old, x)` (`test_adjust_speed.R` takes the copy but never
    asserts on it; new tests must)
  - both a stop_times-based (`poa`) and a frequency-based (`saopaulo`) feed
    when behaviour can differ
  - if the worker path changed: `parallel = FALSE` vs `parallel = TRUE,
    ncores = 2` give identical output
- Tests run on CRAN (no global skip in `tests/testthat.R`): keep them fast,
  use ≤ 2 cores, and write only to `tempdir()`. (`test_read_gtfs.R` currently
  copies and unzips `poa.zip` into the working directory; backlog.)
- Restore global state (`future::plan`, options, files) with `on.exit()`;
  `withr` is not a dependency.

## A8. Performance

- `gtfs2gps()` is the hot path: per shape it segmentizes, snaps stops (C++),
  computes haversine distances (C++) and expands trips/frequencies. Watch for
  avoidable `copy()`s inside per-trip loops, `sf` calls where `sfheaders` or
  C++ would do, repeated `sf::st_coordinates()` on the same object, and large
  objects captured by the worker closure (they are serialised to every
  worker).
- **A claimed speed-up needs evidence:** `bench::mark(old = ..., new = ...,
  check = FALSE)` on at least `poa.zip` (plus `saopaulo.zip` when frequencies
  matter), results compared with `all.equal()`, and timings recorded in the
  plan or session log. Benchmark with `parallel = FALSE` unless parallel
  overhead is the subject. `bench` is a dev tool, not a dependency.
- Don't add a hard dependency (Imports) without a plan that justifies it.

## A9. NEWS.md

The file starts with `# log history of gtfs2gps package development`, then one
`# gtfs2gps vX.Y-Z` section per release with nested bullets:

```
# gtfs2gps (development version)

* Major changes
  * `fun()` now ... Closes #123.

* Minor changes
  * Fixed a bug in `fun()` that ... (#123). PR contribution by @handle.
```

Add the `(development version)` heading if absent; the maintainer renames it at
release. Credit external contributors.

## A10. Figures (vignette, README, pkgdown)

- **[NEW] Publication-ready standard for new or modified figures:** one
  consistent theme, a colour-blind-safe palette (viridis / Okabe-Ito),
  labelled axes with units, fixed `fig.width`/`fig.height`/`dpi` in chunk
  options, maps in EPSG 4326 or a stated projected CRS. Plotting packages stay
  in Suggests and chunks are gated with `requireNamespace()`.
- Existing figures are restyled only through a plan.

---

# Part B: general CRAN standard

- **DESCRIPTION:** `Imports` for code in `R/`, `Suggests` for
  tests/vignettes/optional paths, `Depends` only for the R version. Version
  floors only when a feature requires them (note: the native pipe `|>` is
  used in `R/`, examples and tests, which requires R ≥ 4.1, while DESCRIPTION
  says `Depends: R (>= 3.5)`; backlog). `Authors@R` with
  roles.
- **Docs:** every export documents all `@param`s, `@return`, and runnable
  `@examples`. Use `\donttest{}` for slow-but-correct examples; never use
  `\dontrun{}` to hide errors.
- **Red flags:**

| Red flag | Do instead |
|---|---|
| `library()`/`require()` in `R/` | `pkg::fun()` |
| Writing outside `tempdir()` | Write only to `tempdir()` or user-supplied paths (`filepath`) |
| `<<-` | Return values (and never across a future boundary) |
| `print()`/`cat()`/`message()`/`stop()`/`warning()` in new code | `cli::cli_inform()`/`cli_abort()`/`cli_warn()`, informative output suppressed by `quiet` |
| `options()`/`par()`/`future::plan()`/threads changed, not restored | `on.exit(..., add = TRUE)` |
| More than 2 cores in tests/examples/vignettes | `ncores = 2` or `parallel = FALSE` |
| `T`/`F` | `TRUE`/`FALSE` |
| Unvalidated enumerated arg | `checkmate::assert_choice()` (A2) |
| `==` on doubles or on `units` vs numeric | tolerance / `all.equal()`; compare `units` with `units::set_units()` |
| Implicit `na.rm` on GPS/GTFS data in new code | State `na.rm` explicitly |
| Growing vectors in loops | Pre-allocate or vectorise |

- **Versioning:** versions look like `2.1-2`; dev versions append `.9000`.
  The maintainer bumps release versions; Claude never does.

## Cross-references

- [`quality-gates.md`](quality-gates.md): when each check must pass.
- `.claude/agents/r-package-reviewer.md` enforces this rule. It is local to the
  maintainer's setup and may be absent in a fresh clone; if so, apply the
  checklist manually.
