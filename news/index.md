# Changelog

## gtfs2gps v2.1-2

CRAN release: 2024-10-08

- Minor changes
  - puts package back on CRAN
  - remove {magrittr} from Suggests
  - Clarifies in the documentation the default behavior of the parameter
    `ncores`. closes
    [\#271](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/gtfs2gps/issues/271). When
    `parallel = FALSE`, this argument is ignored. When
    `parallel = TRUE`, then by default the function uses all available
    cores minus one.

## gtfs2gps v2.1-1

CRAN release: 2023-04-28

- Major changes
  - Filter functions were removed from the package because gtftools
    alredy implements them
  - Function `gtfs2gps` now uses `parallel = TRUE` by default.
  - Function `gtfs2gps` now uses
    [`gtfstools::frequencies_to_stop_times()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfstools/reference/frequencies_to_stop_times.html)
    to convert. frequency-based GTFS feeds to stop times before
    processing the data.
- Minor changes
  - New argument `quiet` to
    [`gtfs2gps()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2gps/reference/gtfs2gps.md)
  - Removed `readr`, `pbapply`, `lwgeom` and `magrittr` from package
    dependencies.

## gtfs2gps v2.0-3

- Minor changes
  - Saving units when using argument `filepath` in
    [`gtfs2gps()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2gps/reference/gtfs2gps.md).

## gtfs2gps v2.0-1

CRAN release: 2022-03-05

- Major changes
  - Imports `gtfstools` package.
- Minor changes
  - Fixing CRAN error and warning related to the vignette.
  - The function
    [`adjust_speed()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2gps/reference/adjust_speed.md)
    now does not change very low speed (1.000000e-12 \[km/h\]) because
    these values indicate a situation of a stopped vehicle. Closed
    [249](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/gtfs2gps/issues/249).

## gtfs2gps v2.0-1

CRAN release: 2022-03-05

- Minor changes
  - [`gtfs2gps()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2gps/reference/gtfs2gps.md)
    now prints a message alerting if there are any trips with negative
    speed values in the output.
    [Closes](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/gtfs2gps/issues/172)
    [\#172](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/gtfs2gps/issues/172).
  - Fixing small bugs in the output of gtfs2gps().

## gtfs2gps v2.0-0

CRAN release: 2022-02-22

- Major changes
  - [`gtfs2gps()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2gps/reference/gtfs2gps.md)
    now creates two points for a stop when arrival and departure exist.
    Speed and travel time are now calculated considering both
    departure\_ and arrival_time columns.
  - The travel statistics in the output table (speed, dist, cumdist,
    cumtime) for a given point are now calculated in relation to the
    previous point. More details in the documentation of the
    [`gtfs2gps()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2gps/reference/gtfs2gps.md)
    function.
  - Names of the output columns of gtfs2gps() were updated
  - New function
    [`adjust_arrival_departure()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2gps/reference/adjust_arrival_departure.md)
    to allow users set a minimum time for dis/embarking times at each
    stop.
  - New function
    [`adjust_speed()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2gps/reference/adjust_speed.md)
    to fix outlier speeds and replace missing speed values with a speed
    set by the user or the average speed of the system. The timestamp
    values are updated accordingly.
  - Fixing several small errors in the output of gtfs2gps(), what breaks
    compatibility with previous versions of the gtfs2gps package.
